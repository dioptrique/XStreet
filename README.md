# SatStreet

SatStreet is a demand-driven, transparent, open-source marketplace where prices move with real interest — not manufactured hype.

## Why SatStreet?

Most marketplaces rely on artificial urgency: fake discounts, countdown timers, and inflated pricing games. SatStreet flips the model.

- Prices go up based on real engagement (views, carts, wishlists, purchases)
- Every price change is logged, explained, and open to the public
- Demand signals are hashed and anchored using blockchain principles
- All logic is open-source and auditable — no black-box algorithms

No hype. Just signal.

## Features

- Dynamic Pricing Engine — prices adjust with buyer demand
- AI Explanation Module — human-readable summaries of why prices changed
- Price Timeline — trackable, transparent history of every product’s evolution
- Blockchain Anchoring — demand snapshots hashed and verifiable
- External Signal Hooks — ready for Google Trends, Reddit, and more
- Fully Simulated Demand Layer — cart/wishlist/view logic without external data
